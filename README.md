# Recommender-System-using-Python
This is a simple django project which has a well-working implementation of recommendation systems(content-based filtering and collaborative filtering) for an e-commerce application using python librabries: NumPy, Pandas, Sklearn

It stores user's search history and use it to recommend(content-based) products.
It has a 'Rating' model which stores user-product-rating data to recommend(collaborative) products.
It also recommend products on popularity based filtering which is nothing but the count of products with maximum orders.
